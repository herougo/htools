# htools
 A cumulative collection of helper functionality for personal use.

# Small To Do

- [] setup.py
- all package (import htools, then recursively find variables and add them to global)
  - problem: but then you don't need to import
    - set as local I guess?
  - problem: what's the point of this again?
  - also consider v2 functions, etc

# Minor To Do

- runnable example registry? (replace RUNNABLE comments)

# Major To Do

- [] refactor 
- [] more code

# Notes for Reusing Existing Code

- idea 1: copy-paste function to the third_party folder, then create a wrapper around it
  - ideal for 1 function
- idea 2: directly use the library, but create a wrapper
- idea 3: copy code and do not create a wrapper (e.g. Stackoverflow)
